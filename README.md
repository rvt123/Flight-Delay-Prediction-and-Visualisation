# Flight-Delay-Prediction-and-Visualisation

The Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes dataset was a part of Data Expo which was organised by " http://stat-computing.org/ ". The data can be downloaded from " http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html " which was described in detail by United States Department of Transportation " https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp ". In my IPYNB Notebooks, I have my sincere attempts to Predict the Flight Delay time and try to visualise them.
